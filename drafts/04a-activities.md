### Section Title
Daily Life & Activities

### Content
**Daily activities are essential to our residents' well-being—supporting physical health, mental sharpness, social connection, and emotional expression.** At West Linn Care, each day offers opportunities tailored to individual interests: puzzles and games to keep minds active, gentle stretching and walks for mobility, arts and crafts for creativity, gardening and outdoor time for fresh air, and shared meals and conversations for meaningful connection. We follow each resident's lead. Some days are for activity, others for quiet rest. We always respect personal preferences while encouraging engagement that brings joy and purpose.
